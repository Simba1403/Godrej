## **Environments:**

Our platform follows a **three-environment setup** to ensure smooth development, testing, and production release cycles. Each environment has a specific role in the software lifecycle:

#### 1. Development (Dev)

- **Purpose:** Used by developers to write, integrate, and test their code at an early stage.
    
- **Access:** Primarily internal (engineering team).
    
- **Key Activities:**
    
    - Feature development, bug fixes, and enhancements.
        
    - Unit testing and integration testing of new code.
        
    - Frequent deployments (multiple times a day possible).

#### 2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT / Staging)

- **Purpose:** Acts as a **mirror of production**, used for QA and business teams to validate functionality.
    
- **Access:** QA, Product Managers, limited business stakeholders.
    
- **Key Activities:**
    
    - End-to-end testing of new features.
        
    - Regression testing to ensure existing features are unaffected.
        
    - User acceptance testing (sign-off before production).

#### 3. Production

- **Purpose:** The **live environment** where real users interact with the system.
    
- **Access:** End-users, customers, and operations teams.
    
- **Key Activities:**
    
    - Serves real customer traffic.
        
    - Only thoroughly tested and signed-off features are deployed here.
        
    - Monitoring, logging, and incident management are critical.

## **Module Catalog (High‚Äëlevel)**

---
## **Roles and Permissions**

In our system, access control is designed using a **Role‚ÄìPermission Model**.
#### Roles

Each user is assigned a role that defines their primary responsibility:

- **Admin (A):** Organization-wide control
    
- **Manager (M):** Member-level access
    
- **Operational Support (O):** Client-focused operations
    
- **Product Support (P):** Product & master data access
    
- **Client (C):** Limited client-only access
#### Permissions

Permissions are modular and based on **bitwise combinations**, allowing flexibility and scalability:

- **Standalone Permissions:** Basic read/write and client-level actions
    
- **Combined Modules:** Larger feature blocks like Instant Analysis, Proposals, and Review workflows
#### Permission Bundles

- **Client Module:** Client + Prospect access with Instant features
    
- **Prospect Module:** Prospect + Instant access
    
- **Master Module:** Master data read/write

This structure ensures **clear separation of responsibilities** while allowing **bundled access** for efficiency.

## **Modules**

### 1.üè¢ Accounts & Role Flow

Our system is structured around **Organizations**, ensuring clear accountability and scalable team management.
##### Organization

- Represents the company as a whole.
    
- Each organization has **one Org Admin** (the owner) with complete control.
##### Members

- Team members added under the organization.
    
- Each member is assigned a **role** (Manager, Operational Support, Product Support).
    
- Roles define their level of access and permissions.
##### Clients

- Clients are **not separate roles** but are linked under the **Member role**.
    
- Relationship Managers (RMs) handle their respective clients.
    
- This ensures every client is mapped to a responsible team member.
